# About
FreeTL is a free-and-open-source software framework for migrating data to and from Clinical Data Research Networks.
A grant proposal around that is currently being developed [in public](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epBaQBUDYVDK9O3tznQTF1hzmAVcLhFOptaV2IHpnds/edit), and once that is submitted on May 5, 2015, this repository will be updated with further information.
